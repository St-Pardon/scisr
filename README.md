## Features
- **URL Shortening:**
Scisr allows users to shorten URLs by pasting a long URL into the Scisr platform and a shorter URL gets automatically generated. The shortened URL is designed to be as short as possible, making it easy to share on social media or through other channels.

- **QR Code Generation:**
Scisr allows users to also generate QR codes for the shortened URLs. Users can download the QR code image and use it in their promotional materials or/and on their website. This feature will be implemented using a third-party QR code generator API, which can be integrated into the Scisr platform.
- **Analytics:**
Scisr provides basic analytics that allow users to track their shortened URL's performance. Users can see how many clicks their shortened URL has received and where the clicks are coming from. We need to track when a URL is used.
- **Link History:**
Scisr allows users to see the history of links theyâ€™ve created so they can easily find and reuse links they have previously created
